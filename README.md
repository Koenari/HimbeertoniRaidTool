## Project status: Maintenance
Due to me not actively playing FFXIV at the moment, there will be fewer updates. I do strive to keep this fully
functional and will try my hardest to have this functional quickly after game updates. However, I will not make
any promises about feature requests.
# HimbeerToni Raid Tool
A Tool for raid leaders and raiders alike. All raiders know the hassle it can be to manage a raid group 
or simply keep track of your gear and strategies. While there is a plethora of good tools to help with all these
tasks online I found myself missing an easily accessible hub for these tasks, especially with an in-game
interface. To counter these hardships, I started this project.

## Functionality

* Lootmaster
  > /hrt lootmaster or /hrt lm
  * Overview of current and BiS Gear of players  
  * Loot distribution helper: Calculates priority for loot based on a rule set
  * Stat calculation: Lets you see stats and their meaning for any gearset present
* Raid planner 
  > /hrt planner or /hrt calendar
  * Plan your raid sessions
  * Keep track of loot and attendance

# HimbeerToni Raid Tool

A Tool for raid leaders and raiders alike. All raiders know the hassle it can be to manage a raid group 
or simply keep track of your gear and strategies. While there is a plethora of good tools to help with all these
tasks online I found myself missing an easily accessible hub for these tasks, especially with an in-game
interface. To counter these hardships, I started this project.
## Functionality

* Lootmaster
  * Overview of current and BiS Gear of players 
      > /lootmaster or /lm
  * Loot distribution helper: Calculates priority for loot based on a rule set
  * Stat calculation: Let's you see stats and their meaning for any gearset present

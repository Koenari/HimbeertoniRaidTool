# HimbeerToni Raid Tool

A Tool for raid leaders and raiders alike. All raiders know the hassle it can be to manage a raid group 
or simply keep track of your gear and strategies. While there is a plethora of good tools to help with all these
tasks online I found myself missing an easily accessible hub for these tasks, especially with an in-game
interface. To counter these hardships, I started this project. 

## Functionality

* Lootmaster
  * Overview of current and BIS Gear of players 
      > /lootmaster or /lm
  * Loot distribution helper: Gives a priotrity for loot based on a rule set
### Future Features
Please refer to the [**Project**](https://github.com/users/Koenari/projects/3)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
This plugin needs [XIV Launcher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) with activated in-game features to work. 

For help with installation and configuration please refer to their [FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/)

### Early Access
This plugin is currently published via my personal Plugin repository [Link](https://github.com/Koenari/MyDalamudPlugins)

Builds released to there are tested to not interrupt functionality of Dalamud and FFXIV Game. There may be bugs in internal features of the plugin though.
### Official 

Unfortunately, there is no official release at this point. This will follow later this year. Until then refer to early access. These builds are tested and safe to use.
